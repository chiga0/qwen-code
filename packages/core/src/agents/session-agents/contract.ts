/**
 * @fileoverview Shared contract for session-centric multi-agent collaboration.
 *
 * The model: an ordinary chat session is the conversation. The user (and other
 * agents) @-mention workspace agents inside it; each mentioned agent runs one
 * turn in its OWN native session (a hidden Qwen ACP session, a Claude Code
 * session, or a Codex thread), keyed by (chat session, agent), and its reply is
 * written back into the same chat session as an authored message. There are no
 * threads, tickets, statuses or sub-tasks.
 *
 * Layer ownership (see docs/plans/2026-10-05-session-multi-agent-redesign.md):
 * - daemon orchestrator (cli/serve/session-agents): queueing, coalescing, live
 *   progress, status, approvals, leases, adapters;
 * - ACP child (cli/acp-integration Session): durable record + model history,
 *   via the `qwen/control/session/external_record` ext method;
 * - transcript-replay (acp-bridge): projects the records for reload, /resume
 *   and export, so the three restore paths share one projection.
 *
 * Cross-package copies: web-shell cannot import core, so the wire shapes the
 * browser reads (`QwenAgentMessageMeta`, `SessionAgentRunFrame`) are mirrored
 * in `packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon/ui/types.ts`. Keep both in sync.

 * - `agent_message`: one agent's finished reply (or its failure), authored.
